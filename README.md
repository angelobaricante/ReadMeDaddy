## Features
ReadMeDaddy offers a range of powerful AI-powered features designed to enhance file management and interaction:

1. **Summarize Content**: Extract key points from DOCX, PPTX, and PDF files.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze data and generate statistics from CSV and XLSX files.
3. **Speaker Notes**: Automatically generate detailed speaker notes for PowerPoint presentations.
4. **Text Simplification**: Simplify, rewrite, and format text in various document types.
5. **Translation and Grammar Check**: Translate text and check grammar and spelling across all supported files.

## Developer Installation
To securely manage the OPEN AI API key, we use environment variables. It is VERY IMPORTANT to follow the [User Installation](#user-installation) instructions to install the app, as you CANNOT RUN the app without the API key. This process will automatically add the API key to your environment variables.
